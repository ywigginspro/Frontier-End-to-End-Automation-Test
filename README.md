<b>Frontier Communications Automated end-to-end<b> 

This project will provide a step-by-step guide for creating and automating end-to-end testing for Frontiers Communications landing page website.

<b>Approach-
The test approach for this project is “usability”.  These 16 test suites are written to allow the test to be used across platforms, browsers and user groups (i.e. QA, DEV or UAT).  The suites are numbered to allow automation of section, area or object. The test suites can also be broken in section for unit, smoke or regression testing.
**Example: The first test case “01URL” This test will validate the URL navigation to landing page to verify the website is up and running. ** 

<b>Running the tests-
This test can be used to on a Windows or MAC operating systems. The test can run in ascending order (from top of the landing page to the footnotes).  Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome 62 can be used for browser page compares (All versions should be tested Firefox, Safari & Opera). All test cases can be converted using Regex.  

<b>End to end tests-
The following is validated for this end to end testing:
  CSS Validation- Validates styles, fonts, header, footers, date/time format, images & alignment
  Page Validation- Link styling, link to landing page, redirects
  Form Validation- Entering null, valid and invalid data 
  
<b>Test Execution-
The test cases are written in Action vs. Expected results. The test will be run in ascending order and will cover each suite. The action will describe steps to execute the test. The expected results section provides validation for the steps. 
**Example: Action: Verify navigation color display for High-Speed Internet. 
Expect Result: Display color #5a5a5a (CSS: Black) **
Test will provide results Pass or Fail. 
 If the actions equal expected test Pass
 If the actions do not equal expected results the test Fails.
